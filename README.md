# landing-page
Create landing page with flexbox

In this exercise I will creat a website landing page
and try to closely match the template provide by 
The Odin Project.
With it I will show, that I have acquired basic 
flexbox skills and have learned to position things 
on a web page.
And I will have created the HTML and CSS from scratch.
